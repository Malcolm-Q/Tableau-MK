# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Create visualizations that are visually pleasing and communicate information effectively.

## Process
After downloading I spent some time visualizing the data and trying to get sense of everything and how it was connected.

Then I started going through the questions and tried a few different variations of every one before I picked the one I was most happy with.

One I really like that quickly communicates a message everyone can easily understand is the heatmap question. I made the traditional heatmap but I also made a marker map and had the size and color of the markers scale depending on price. Then I put the year in the pages so you could scroll through the entire timeframe and have it be animated.

## Results
I chose option 1

I ended up making quite a few line plots as a lot of questions were 'show x through time.'

For my story I used a lot of dashboards comparing two visualizations against eachother.

For the heatmap question I used a heatmap with a blue to red color scheme indicating price.

## Challenges 
The time spent making sense of the data was definetly the most time consuming challenge. After that it was mostly just the tedius task of dragging and dropping and tweaking until it looked okay or represented what you wanted. There were a couple times where I spent a good amount of time trying to get it to display exactly what I wanted/how I wanted it but it wasn't too bad.

## Future Goals
I would have tried to combine this with data from other sources to make it feel fuller.
